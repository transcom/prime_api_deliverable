## Using the CLI Prime API Client

This document details how to test the Prime API locally using the Prime API Client.


## Requirements

You've successfully run the [Prime Docker](run-prime-docker.md) via `make run_prime_docker`. If you haven't, please follow [these instructions](#tbd)


## Sub-commands

- `fetch-mtos`
  * Fetches all the move task orders
- `update-mto-shipment` 
  * Updates an mto shipment with the data passed in
- `create-mto-service-item` 
  * Creates a new mto service item for a shipment

For more details on the endpoints targeted with these commands, view the [API Endpoints documentation](#api-endpoints).

## Testing Prime API: Fetch MTOS

1. Run this command:

    ```sh
    go run ./cmd/prime-api-client --insecure fetch-mtos | jq
    ```

2. If successful you should receive a response similar to:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "createdAt": "2020-01-22",
        "id": "5d4b25bb-eb04-4c03-9a81-ee0398cb7791",
        "isAvailableToPrime": true,
        "isCanceled": false,
        "moveOrderID": "6fca843a-a87e-4752-b454-0fac67aa4981",
        "mto_service_items": [{ ... }],
        "mto_shipments": [{ ... }],
        "payment_requests": [],
        "reference_id": "1234-4321",
        "updatedAt": "2020-01-22"
      },
      {...},
    ]
    ```

## Testing Prime API: Update MTO Shipment

Before updating a shipment, you need to figure out the ID, the MTO ID, and the ETag of the shipment you'll be updating. You can accomplish this by using the `fetch-mtos` sub-command. You must also have data to pass in the form of a JSON file. Data must have at least the ID and MTO ID. Additionally, any field you are attempting to update should be part of this data. For example:

```json
{
  "id": "df2725cf-ee88-4fe5-90e7-a693b551dd3a",
  "moveTaskOrderID": "5d4b25bb-eb04-4c03-9a81-ee0398cb7791",
  "actualPickupDate": "2020-03-25"
}
```

1. Run this command:

    ```sh
    go run ./cmd/prime-api-client --insecure update-mto-shipment --etag {ETAG} --filename {PATH TO FILE} | jq
    ```

2. If successful you should receive a response similar to:

    ```json
         {
            "actualPickupDate": "2020-03-25",
            "agents": [
              {
                "agentType": "RELEASING_AGENT",
                "createdAt": "0001-01-01",
                "email": "test@test.email.com",
                "firstName": "Test",
                "id": "b870fe0c-f2a1-4372-9d44-eaaf54a1b45d",
                "lastName": "Agent",
                "mtoShipmentID": "df2725cf-ee88-4fe5-90e7-a693b551dd3a",
                "updatedAt": "0001-01-01"
              },
              {...}
            ],
            "createdAt": "2020-03-25T15:42:28.992Z",
            "customerRemarks": "please treat gently",
            "destinationAddress": {...},
            "eTag": "MjAyMC0wMy0yNVQxNTo0MjoyOC45OTI1ODFa",
            "id": "df2725cf-ee88-4fe5-90e7-a693b551dd3a",
            "moveTaskOrderID": "5d4b25bb-eb04-4c03-9a81-ee0398cb7791",
             ...
          }
    ```

## Testing Prime API: Create MTO Service Item

Before creating a new MTO service item, you need to figure out the ID and the MTO ID of the shipment you'll be updating. You can accomplish this by using the `fetch-mtos` sub-command. You must also have data to pass in the form of a JSON file. Data must have at least the ID and MTO ID plus the Model Type, Pickup Postal Code, and Reason for the new service item. For example:

  ```json
 {
   "modelType": "MTOServiceItemDOFSIT",
   "moveTaskOrderID": "5d4b25bb-eb04-4c03-9a81-ee0398cb7791",
   "mtoShipmentID": "df2725cf-ee88-4fe5-90e7-a693b551dd3a",
   "pickupPostalCode": "90802",
   "reason": "sometimes stuff happens"
 }
  ```

  1. Run this command:

      ```sh
      go run ./cmd/prime-api-client --insecure create-mto-service-item --filename {PATH TO FILE} | jq
      ```

  2. If successful you should receive a response similar to:

      ```json
        {
          "pickupPostalCode": "90802",
          "reServiceCode": "DOFSIT",
          "reason": "sometimes stuff happens",
          "eTag": "MjAyMC0wMy0yNVQxNjowMTowMS41ODg0MTha",
          "id": "10873d77-b617-40a3-a66d-3b8f4389ba5e",
          "modelType": "MTOServiceItemDOFSIT",
          "moveTaskOrderID": "5d4b25bb-eb04-4c03-9a81-ee0398cb7791",
          "reServiceID": "998beda7-e390-4a83-b15e-578a24326937"
        }
      ```


## Quick Tricks

You've seen this at the beginning of each command:

```sh
go run ./cmd/prime-api-client
```

You can shorten it by doing the following

```sh
rm -f bin/prime-api-client
make bin/prime-api-client
```

Then every time you see `go run ./cmd/prime-api-client` you can replace it with simply `prime-api-client`. For example:

```shell script
prime-api-client --insecure fetch-mtos
```
