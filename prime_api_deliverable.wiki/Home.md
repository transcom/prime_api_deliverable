## Introduction
The Prime API is a subset of the MilMove API that makes it possible for the Prime contractor to consume and update data related to move orders.

It is a RESTful API that accepts JSON-encoded request bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses. It uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs, and mutual TLS for authentication.

The Prime API uses the [Swagger 2.0 specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/). Swagger allows developers to define what their API will look like and easily provide [documentation](https://github.com/transcom/prime_api_deliverable/wiki/API-Endpoints#documentation-using-redoc) in a human-readable format.

This wiki contains documentation on the latest version of the Prime API, Milestone 3.
